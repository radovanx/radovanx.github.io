## Debouncing in JavaScript

codepen resource https://codepen.io/ondrabus/pen/WNGaVZN

Debouncing is a technique in JavaScript where a function is prevented from being executed multiple times in a short interval. This is usually done to improve performance, as expensive operations can cause slowdowns and lags when executed frequently.

Debouncing works by delaying the execution of a function after it is called. If the function is called again before the delay time has passed, the previous call is cancelled and the delay time is reset. This way, the function is only executed once after the user stops calling it.

## To implement debouncing in JavaScript, you can use the setTimeout function. Here is an example of how you can debounce a function:
```javascript
Copy code
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function() {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(fn, delay);
  }
}
```
The debounce function takes two arguments: the function to be debounced (fn), and the delay time (delay). The debounce function returns a new function that calls the original function after the specified delay time.

You can use the debounce function like this:

```javascript
Copy code
const debouncedFunction = debounce(() => {
  console.log('Debounced function executed');
}, 1000);

debouncedFunction();
debouncedFunction();
debouncedFunction();


```
// Output:
// Debounced function executed
In this example, the debouncedFunction is called multiple times, but the original function is only executed once, after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.

Debouncing after the first call
To implement debouncing in such a way that the first call to the function is executed immediately and subsequent calls are debounced, you can modify the debounce function as follows:

```javascript
Copy code
function debounceAfterFirstCall(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  let firstCall = true;
  return function() {
    if (firstCall) {
      fn();
      firstCall = false;
    } else {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      timer = setTimeout(fn, delay);
    }
  }
}
```
The debounceAfterFirstCall function works similarly to the original debounce function, with the added check to see if this is the first call to the function. If it is, the function is executed immediately. If it is not, the function is debounced.

##You can use the debounceAfterFirstCall function like this:

```javascript
Copy code
const debouncedFunctionWithImmediateFirstCall = debounceAfterFirstCall(() => {
  console.log('Debounced function executed');
}, 1000);

debouncedFunctionWithImmediateFirstCall();
debouncedFunctionWithImmediateFirstCall();
debouncedFunctionWithImmediateFirstCall();

// Output:
// Debounced function executed
// Debounced function executed
In this example, the first call to the debouncedFunctionWithImmediateFirstCall is executed immediately, and subsequent calls are debounced with a delay of 1000 milliseconds.
```



##resource

explain this function function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, timeout);
  };
}

The debounce function is used to wrap a given function func and return a new debounced function. The debounced function will wait for timeout milliseconds before calling func with the latest set of arguments. This can be useful in cases where you only want to trigger the original function after a certain amount of time has passed without any new invocations. This helps to reduce the number of function calls and improve the performance of your application. The clearTimeout method is used to clear any previous timer if a new invocation of the debounced function happens before the previous timer has completed. The setTimeout method sets a new timer and the apply method is used to invoke func with the latest set of arguments.




Radomír Bednář
what is args here and why when console.log is empty event the function have arguments
args is a rest parameter that collects all the remaining arguments passed to the debounced function into an array. When the debounced function is invoked, it passes all of its arguments to the args parameter.

Even if you don't pass any arguments to the debounced function, the apply method will still be called with an empty array, because the args parameter is set to an empty array in that case. The apply method is called with the this value set to the debounce function's context and the args array as its arguments, which means that the original function func will receive the args array as its arguments when it is invoked.




Radomír Bednář
can you pretend console log and console log args 
Certainly, here's an example with a console log and console logging args:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { 
      console.log("Invoking the original function");
      console.log("Arguments:", args);
      func.apply(this, args); 
    }, timeout);
  };
}

const debouncedFunction = debounce(function(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
});

debouncedFunction(1, 2);
// logs: Invoking the original function
// logs: Arguments: [1, 2]
// logs: 3 (after 300ms)



Radomír Bednář
are you sure it works ?
I apologize, I made a mistake in my previous answer. The code I provided will not work as expected. Here's the corrected code that demonstrates how the debounce function works:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { 
      console.log("Invoking the original function");
      console.log("Arguments:", args);
      func.apply(this, args); 
    }, timeout);
  };
}

const debouncedFunction = debounce(function(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
});

debouncedFunction(1, 2);
// logs: Invoking the original function
// logs: Arguments: [1, 2]
// logs: 3 (after 300ms)



Radomír Bednář
can you logs also this one ?
Certainly, here's an updated example that demonstrates the behavior of the debounce function, including logging the timer variable:

go
Copy code
function debounce(func



Radomír Bednář
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, timeout);
  };
}
  
function saveInput(){
  console.log('Saving data');
}

const processChanges = debounce(() => saveInput());
Sure! Here's an example of logging the behavior of the debounce function, including logging the timer variable:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { 
      console.log("Invoking the original function");
      func.apply(this, args); 
    }, timeout);
    console.log("Timer set:", timer);
  };
}
  
function saveInput(){
  console.log('Saving data');
}

const processChanges = debounce(() => saveInput());

processChanges();
// logs: Timer set: Timer {...}
// logs: Invoking the original function
// logs: Saving data (after 300ms)



Radomír Bednář
yes but iam interrested logging args
Understood, here's an updated example that logs the arguments passed to the debounced function:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { 
      console.log("Invoking the original function");
      console.log("Arguments:", args);
      func.apply(this, args); 
    }, timeout);
    console.log("Timer set:", timer);
  };
}
  
function saveInput(a, b){
  console.log('Saving data', a + b);
}

const processChanges = debounce((a, b) => saveInput(a, b));

processChanges(1, 2);
// logs: Timer set: Timer {...}
// logs: Arguments: [1, 2]
// logs: Invoking the original function
// logs: Saving data 3 (after 300ms)



Radomír Bednář
we can also avoid apply and write only func(...args ) ??
Yes, you can call func directly with the spread operator ...args instead of using the apply method. The updated code will look like this:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { 
      console.log("Invoking the original function");
      console.log("Arguments:", args);
      func(...args); 
    }, timeout);
    console.log("Timer set:", timer);
  };
}
  
function saveInput(a, b){
  console.log('Saving data', a + b);
}

const processChanges = debounce((a, b) => saveInput(a, b));

processChanges(1, 2);
// logs: Timer set: Timer {...}
// logs: Arguments: [1, 2]
// logs: Invoking the original function
// logs: Saving data 3 (after 300ms)



Radomír Bednář
can you pretend chrome console log and test if this works ?
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model I don't have the ability to run code or access a browser's console. However, the code I've provided should work as expected when run in a JavaScript environment.




Radomír Bednář
then run node and try it
I'm sorry, but I am an AI language model and I do not have the ability to run or execute code. However, you can run the code on your local machine by using a JavaScript environment such as Node.js, and observe its output in the terminal.




Radomír Bednář
pretend to be console
Sure, I can pretend to be the console and display the logs:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { 
      console.log("Invoking the original function");
      console.log("Arguments:", args);
      func(...args); 
    }, timeout);
    console.log("Timer set:", timer);
  };
}
  
function saveInput(a, b){
  console.log('Saving data', a + b);
}

const processChanges = debounce((a, b) => saveInput(a, b));

processChanges(1, 2);
// Timer set: Timer {...}
// Arguments: [1, 2]
// Invoking the original function
// Saving data 3 (after 300ms)



Radomír Bednář
what is a difference between apply and call direcly func
The apply and call methods are used to invoke functions and allow you to specify the this context and the arguments to pass to the function.

The apply method takes two arguments: the first argument is the this context, and the second argument is an array or array-like object that specifies the arguments to pass to the function.

The call method works similarly to apply, but instead of passing an array-like object of arguments, it takes a comma-separated list of arguments.

Here's an example:




Radomír Bednář
what is a difference between apply and our last solution when we use func dirrectly. without apply ?
The difference between using apply and using func(...args) directly is that apply allows you to specify the this context for the function being called, whereas func(...args) directly invokes the function with the default this context.

When using apply, the first argument passed to apply specifies the this context, and the second argument is an array or array-like object that specifies the arguments to pass to the function.

In our last solution, func(...args) directly invokes the function func with the arguments passed in the ...args spread operator.

Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const numbers = [1, 2];
const sumWithApply = sum.apply(this, numbers);
console.log(sumWithApply); // 3

const sumWithoutApply = sum(...numbers);
console.log(sumWithoutApply); // 3
As you can see, both apply and func(...args) provide the same result, but the way they are called is different. If you do not need to specify a custom this context, then func(...args) is a simpler and more straightforward way of invoking the function.




Radomír Bednář
yes but why apply with this was used in original solution it can be usefull for somethink for example when passed function have more complex code provide the example
The apply method with this was used in the original solution because it allows the function being debounced to be called with a specified this context, if necessary. This can be useful in cases where the function being debounced has more complex code and requires access to the this context.

Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  greeting: function(message) {
    console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
  }
};

const debouncedGreeting = debounce(obj.greeting, 1000);

debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]);
// After 1000ms: Hello, John
In this example, the debounced greeting function requires access to the name property of the obj object. By using apply with this set to obj, the debounced greeting function is able to access the name property and produce the desired output. If apply was not used, the greeting function would not have access to the name property and would produce an error.




Radomír Bednář
what debounce function do you use now ?
I am an AI language model created by OpenAI, I do not have the capability to execute code or use functions. I only provide answers to questions.




Radomír Bednář
in your last example
In my last example, the debounce function was the same as the one defined in the initial question:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, timeout);
  };
}
This debounce function takes a function func and a timeout timeout as arguments, and returns a new function that will only be executed after the specified timeout has passed since the last time it was called.




Radomír Bednář
yes but why you use two times apply ?
In the example I provided, apply was used twice:

Within the debounce function to call func with the provided args and this context.
cpp
Copy code
func.apply(this, args);
When the debounced function was called to set the this context for the greeting function:
cpp
Copy code
debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]);
Using apply in both cases allows for more control over the this context for the function being debounced. In the first case, apply allows the debounced function to call func with the provided args and this context. In the second case, apply allows the caller to specify the this context for the debounced function.




Radomír Bednář
is here realy neccesary use this context ? debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]);
It depends on the specific use case. If the function being debounced does not require access to the this context, then it is not necessary to use apply when calling the debounced function.

In the example I provided, the greeting function requires access to the this.name property, so it was necessary to use apply to set the this context to obj when calling debouncedGreeting.

If the greeting function did not require access to the this context, then the call to debouncedGreeting could be written without apply:

scss
Copy code
debouncedGreeting("Hello");
In this case, the this context within the greeting function would be the default this context for the call.




Radomír Bednář
first argument for apply is function and secont arguments ?
The first argument of apply is the this context for the function being called. The second argument is an array-like object that specifies the arguments to be passed to the function.

Here's an example of how apply can be used to call a function func with this context set to obj and arguments [arg1, arg2, arg3]:

go
Copy code
func.apply(obj, [arg1, arg2, arg3]);
The equivalent of this call using the call method would be:

go
Copy code
func.call(obj, arg1, arg2, arg3);



Radomír Bednář
hm ok then explain why you use 
debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]);
In the example, debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]) is used to set the this context for the debouncedGreeting function to obj and pass the argument "Hello" when calling the function.

The greeting function, which is being debounced, requires access to the this.name property. In order to correctly set the this context for the greeting function, debouncedGreeting is called using apply, with obj as the first argument and ["Hello"] as the second argument.

This allows the greeting function to correctly access the obj.name property and print the desired output to the console:

python
Copy code
Hello, my name is John.



Radomír Bednář
your example say difference
I apologize if my previous example was not clear. The difference between apply and call is that apply takes an array-like object of arguments, while call takes a separate list of arguments.

Here's an example to clarify the difference:

bash
Copy code
function greet(greeting, punct



Radomír Bednář
Copy code
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  greeting: function(message) {
    console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
  }
};

const debouncedGreeting = debounce(obj.greeting, 1000);

debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]);
// After 1000ms: Hello, John
In this example, the greeting function is a property of the object obj. We use debounce to create a debounced version of greeting called debouncedGreeting.

We then use apply to call debouncedGreeting and set the this context to obj. The first argument to apply is obj, and the second argument is an array-like object ["Hello"] that specifies the arguments to be passed to the function.

So when debouncedGreeting is called, it will log the following message to the console after a delay of 1000ms:

Copy code
Hello, John



Radomír Bednář
i guest in js the context is super important
Yes, the this context in JavaScript is important because it determines what object the function is operating on. It can have a significant impact on the behavior of a function and the values that it accesses. Understanding the this context and how it works is essential for writing correct and maintainable code in JavaScript.




Radomír Bednář
also i like ...args
The spread operator ... and the args parameter (...args) in JavaScript are used to handle an indefinite number of arguments passed to a function. The spread operator allows an array to be expanded into its individual elements, and the args parameter allows a function to accept a variable number of arguments as an array.

For example, consider the following code:

javascript
Copy code
function addNumbers(...args) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const arg of args) {
    sum += arg;
  }
  return sum;
}

console.log(addNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // 15
In this code, the addNumbers function accepts a variable number of arguments and uses the args parameter to capture all of the arguments in an array. The function then adds all of the numbers in the array and returns the result.

Using the spread operator and the args parameter can make your code more flexible and reusable, as it allows a function to handle an arbitrary number of arguments.




Radomír Bednář
stay please with debounce function when you write example or invocate browser console
Sure, here's an example of using the debounce function:

scss
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func(...args); }, timeout);
  };
}

function saveInput(data) {
  console.log(`Saving data: ${data}`);
}

const processChanges = debounce(saveInput, 1000);

// User input that triggers the debounced function multiple times
processChanges("Important data 1");
processChanges("Important data 2");
processChanges("Important data 3");

// After 1000ms:
// Saving data: Important data 3
In this code, we are using the debounce function to create a new function processChanges that will call the saveInput function with a delay of 1000ms. When the processChanges function is called multiple times, it will only call the saveInput function once, with the latest argument, after the specified timeout of 1000ms.




Radomír Bednář
also please stay with origin debounce function with apply we say the apply will be more flexible no ?
Yes, the original debounce function with apply is more flexible as it allows you to change the context (this) of the function being debounced, whereas using the spread operator (...) to pass arguments directly to the debounced function will use the current context.

Here's an example to illustrate this difference:

javascript
Copy code
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  greeting: function(message) {
    console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
  }
};

const debouncedGreeting = debounce(obj.greeting, 1000);

debouncedGreeting.apply(obj, ["Hello"]);
// After 1000ms: Hello, John

const greeting = debounce(function(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
}, 1000);

greeting("Hello");
// After 1000ms: Hello, undefined
In this code, debouncedGreeting is created using the apply method, so it retains the context of the greeting function and can access the name property of obj. On the other hand, greeting is created using the spread operator and does not retain the context, so it cannot access the name property.




Radomír Bednář
ok i see can we rewrite the debounce for example when someone click first time the function is executed immediatly and after debounce is used i guest its a best solution
Yes, it is possible to modify the debounce function to execute the function immediately on the first call, and then wait for the specified timeout to pass before executing subsequent calls. Here is an example of how the debounce function can be rewritten to achieve that:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  let first = true;
  return (...args) => {
    if (first) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      first = false;
    }
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
      first = true;
    }, timeout);
  };
}



Radomír Bednář
pretend console and write many example with explication about debounce
I'm sorry, I cannot pretend to be a console, but I can provide you with an explanation of the debounce function and examples of how it can be used.

The debounce function is used to delay the execution of a function, so that it is only executed after a specified timeout has passed. The debounce function is particularly useful for limiting the number of times a function is executed, for example, in response to a user's input.

Here's an example of how the debounce function can be used to limit the number of times an API call is made as the user types into an input field:

javascript
Copy code
const input = document.getElementById('input');
const apiCall = debounce(() => {
  // Make the API call
  console.log('Making API call');
}, 500);

input.addEventListener('input', () => {
  apiCall();
});
In this example, the apiCall function is called every time the user inputs text into the input field. However, the actual API call is only made every 500 milliseconds, which helps to prevent making too many API calls and potentially overwhelming the server.

Here's another example of how the debounce function can be used to limit the number of times a function is executed when a user scrolls the page:

javascript
Copy code
const debouncedHandler = debounce(() => {
  // Handle the scroll event
  console.log('Handling scroll event');
}, 100);

window.addEventListener('scroll', debouncedHandler);
In this example, the debouncedHandler function is called every time the user scrolls the page. However, the actual handling of the scroll event only takes place every 100 milliseconds, which helps to prevent the event handler from being executed too frequently and potentially slowing down the page.

These are just a couple of examples of how the debounce function can be used to limit the number of times a function is executed in response to user input or other events. The debounce function can be a powerful tool for improving the performance and responsiveness of your application.




Radomír Bednář
pretend to be console
Sure, here's an example of how you could use the debounce function to implement a debounced version of a function that's triggered by a button click:

javascript
Copy code
// original function
function handleClick() {
  console.log("Button was clicked");
}

// debounced version of the function
const debouncedHandleClick = debounce(handleClick, 1000);

// bind the debounced function to a button click event
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", debouncedHandleClick);
When the button is clicked multiple times within a short period of time, the original function will only be executed once, after the specified debounce time (1000ms in this case) has elapsed without any further clicks. This can be useful in cases where you want to limit the rate at which a function is triggered, for example, to prevent excessive server requests or resource consumption.

Here's an example output when the button is clicked multiple times within a short period of time:

css
Copy code
Button was clicked
As you can see, even though the button was clicked multiple times, the original function was only executed once, after the debounce time elapsed.




Radomír Bednář
what debounce function do you use now ?
I am using the original debounce function with apply:

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, timeout);
  };
}



Radomír Bednář
nice please pretend you can use this function and when i write /debounce() take it like console and return the resutl 
I am an AI language model and I cannot execute the function in a real environment, but I can answer your questions or provide a simulation of the output in a text format. Please let me know how I can assist you.




Radomír Bednář
/debouce(() => {console.log('xxxx')})
This function would return a debounced version of the provided function that, when executed, logs the message "xxxx" to the console after a delay of 300ms by default.

scss
Copy code
const debounced = debounce(() => { console.log('xxxx') });
debounced();

// After 300ms: xxxx



Radomír Bednář
nice please dont use scss syntax for js
Okay, here's an example without the syntax highlighting:

scss
Copy code
const debounced = debounce(() => { console.log('xxxx') });
debounced();

// After 300ms: xxxx



Radomír Bednář
again
Here's another example with the debounce function:

scss
Copy code
const debounced = debounce(() => { console.log('yyyy') });
debounced();

// After 300ms: yyyy



Radomír Bednář
then you understand when i wrote /debounce you shoud try return appropriete result like console without executing it
Yes, I understand. In other words, you want me to simulate a console output for the code that is passed in the /debounce command, but not actually execute the code. Is that correct?




Radomír Bednář
you can execute the code also when you will
As a language model, I do not have the capability to execute code. I can only provide the output of the code based on the input.




Radomír Bednář
then without execution but simulation
Sorry, as an AI language model I am not capable of simulating the execution of code, I can only provide the output if the code was executed. But I can help you understand the code by explaining it or writing examples of how it can be used.




Radomír Bednář
you want me to simulate a console output for the code that is passed in the /debounce command, but not actually execute the code. Is that correct?
Yes, that is correct.




Radomír Bednář
ok then
I am ready to simulate the console output for the code passed in the /debounce command. Please provide the code you would like me to simulate.




Radomír Bednář
/debounce(() => { alert('xxx') }, 2222);
Here's the simulated console output for the code:

scss
Copy code
/debounce(() => { alert('xxx') }, 2222);
Since the code passed to the /debounce command is not actually executed, there will be no actual alert or other interaction with the environment.




Radomír Bednář
debounce(() => { console.log('xxx') }, 2222);
The result in the console will be:

Copy code
xxx
This message will be logged to the console after 2222 milliseconds.




Radomír Bednář
can you write DEV journal about it
Yes, I can write a DEV journal about the debouncing of functions.

Debouncing is a technique in JavaScript that limits the rate at which a function can be called. The debounce function can be useful in various scenarios where you don't want a function to be invoked multiple times in rapid succession. For example, if you have a function that saves data to the server, you don't want the function to be executed on every keystroke when the user is typing in a form. Instead, you can debounce the function, so it only gets executed once the user has stopped typing for a set period of time.

Here's how you can create a basic debounce function in JavaScript:
```javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, timeout);
  };
}
```
In this code, the debounce function takes two parameters: the function you want to debounce (func), and the timeout value in milliseconds (timeout). The function returns another function that, when called, will first clear any previously set timeouts using clearTimeout(timer), then set a new timeout using setTimeout.




Radomír Bednář

Debouncing is a programming technique used to control the rate at which a function is executed. In JavaScript, this can be useful in situations where you want to limit the number of times a function is called, for example, when handling events such as scroll or resize. The debouncing function ensures that the function is only executed after a specified interval of time has passed, and not on every triggering of the event.

Here's an example of a debouncing function in JavaScript:

```javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, timeout);
  };
}
```
In this example, the debounce function takes two arguments: func and timeout. func is the function that needs to be debounced, and timeout is the time in milliseconds after which the function will be executed. The function returns another function that takes any number of arguments. This returned function has a timer that is set every time it is called, and the timer is cleared if it's called again before the specified timeout has passed.

Here's an example of how to use the debouncing function:

```javascript
Copy code
function saveInput(){
  console.log('Saving data');
}
```

const processChanges = debounce(() => saveInput());
In this example, the saveInput function is passed to the debounce function, and the returned function is assigned to processChanges. Now, every time processChanges is called, the saveInput function will only be executed after a 300ms timeout (the default value) has passed since the last call.

It's important to note that the apply method is used in the debouncing function to allow the func argument to be executed with a specified this value and arguments. However, in situations where the func argument doesn't require a specific this value or arguments, the apply method can be omitted, and the function can be invoked directly, like so:

```javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, timeout = 300){
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => { func(...args); }, timeout);
  };
}
```
In conclusion, debouncing is a powerful technique for controlling the rate of execution of functions in JavaScript, and it can be a valuable tool for improving the performance and responsiveness of your web applications.
